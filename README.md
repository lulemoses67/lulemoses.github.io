I am a self-taught programmer, i started by learning the foundations of programming with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And after understanding the basics , i decided to take Web development as my first specialisation as a programmer and currently am a front-end developer. Currently, i create websites and host them on free web hosting platforms like github-pages and i share my work to my friends and on my social media to get visitors. Though my websites are not yet published but i always challenge myself to do the best. I have created full website templates for blogsites, real estates services and selling websites. I saved all my projects on github repository @lulemoses67. This has given me a real work experience mostly on how work is done and mostly remote.

Hi , am Moses a front-end developer with one year experience , I develop and design webpages, websites and web applications using HTML, CSS with SASS, JAVASCRIPT and PHP with my SQL.
Am self-taught and I  started in 2019 by learning the foundation of programming with HTML, CSS and JavaScript from Duke University via Coursera .  Then I started creating and designing webpages like  a homepage, form pages  and some CSS cards. And when I understood the basics  I decided to take web development as my first tech specialization and learn more about it by taking more courses, readings and daily practice. And after sometime I enrolled for Responsive Web design from University of London via Coursera where I was introduced to more web development skills like bootstrap , jQuery and more JavaScript like handlebars.js . This also introduced me to front-end development and since then most of my work has been front-end.  And after that I decided to learn PHP and my SQL since a lot of websites are built using PHP. 
All that time I have been learning things and practicing them in my projects like personal website , personal blog and other projects saved on my GitHub repo.
Currently am still learning and getting more advanced knowledge about the programming languages I have learnt like now am enrolled to front-end development with Reacts from The University of Hong Kong and other internet resources as am working on some personal projects and looking for a break through.
After all that experience, I have developed some personal key skills in the subject like solving problems.
I intend to  become a full stack developer with time.
I love technology and I like talking about tech.
Thank you.
