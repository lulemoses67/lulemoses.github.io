  description : "Hi , am Moses a front-end developer with one year experience , I develop and design webpages, websites and web applications using HTML, CSS with SASS, JAVASCRIPT and PHP with my SQL. Am self-taught and I started in 2019 by learning the foundation of programming with HTML, CSS and JavaScript from Duke University via Coursera . Then I started creating and designing webpages like a homepage, form pages and some CSS cards. And when I understood the basics I decided to take web development as my first tech specialization and learn more about it by taking more courses, readings and daily practice. And after sometime I enrolled for Responsive Web design from University of London via Coursera where I was introduced to more web development skills like bootstrap , jQuery and more JavaScript like handlebars.js . This also introduced me to front-end development and since then most of my work has been front-end. And after that I decided to learn PHP and my SQL since a lot of websites are built using PHP. All that time I have been learning things and practicing them in my projects like personal website , personal blog and other projects saved on my GitHub repo. Currently am still learning and getting more advanced knowledge about the programming languages I have learnt like now am enrolled to front-end development with Reacts from The University of Hong Kong and other internet resources as am working on some personal projects and looking for a break through. After all that experience, I have developed some personal key skills in the subject like solving problems. I intend to become a full stack developer with time. I love technology and I like talking about tech. Thank you.",
